<h1>Inspiration</h1>
<h2>Find your best college match and financial aid package with us!</h2>
<p>While some of us are gifted with unconditional support to pursue higher education, others simply do not consider it an option, because they cannot afford to. Whether it be the ever-increasing college tuition, or the ever-decreasing admission rates for colleges, higher education seems rise farther and farther from those who are less privileged. </p>
<p>The resources that are currently available help solve these problems are often not as accessible as they should be. Sometimes they are buried deep under an ugly .gov website, other times they are simply too complicated to use. Even college counseling is targeted and marketed towards those who already excel in school, rather than those who need the guidance the most to continue their education.</p>
<p>So we decided to make a college search/match platform that is inclusive for underprivileged students, and a chrome extension that walks them through FAFSA, the most important financial aid application.</p>
